## The Basics

PokeGoNav is an open project done by a member of the community to give back to
the community. If you want to see a new feature or find a bug, please, 
[report it][report].

Instead, if you're looking to contribute code, we ask you start with any issues
marked "[help wanted][help-wanted]". These are issues that we've identified as
issues or improvements we want, but the core developers would prefer the 
community submit a fix.

_Please, do not work on any issues that are assigned. This means that the 
developer is actively working on these issues and you will be duplicating 
effort._

## Code Review

All code will be reviewed via merge requests. It will not be accepted until one
of the core developers have signed off on it. You will be asked to make changes
to styling, or implementation details, or the like. (Trust me, it always 
happens.) Please be curteous and respectful; this is not a job for any of us,
and we understand your passion for code you've written. But, keeping things
professional will keep it easier on all of us moving forward.

If we do not accept your merge request, please understand. We will try to 
explain our rational, and engage with you as best as we can on why. Don't feel
discouraged, it certainly is not personal.
